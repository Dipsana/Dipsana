# 👋 Hi, I’m Dipsana

- 👨‍💻 I’m a 3rd year B.Tech CSE student who loves technology and learning new things!
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, web development, and building a custom OS someday 🌌
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Web Development, and sharpening my DSA skills
- 💞️ I’m building this repo to track and revise my learning journey — from C, Java to DBMS and more
- 📚 I believe in slow and steady progress and enjoy coding with curiosity
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to play the tabla, and I still vibe with it during breaks 🎵
- 🧠 Motto: Learn at your own pace, but never stop.
